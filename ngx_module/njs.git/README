NGINX JavaScript (njs)
----------

njs is a subset of the JavaScript language that allows extending nginx
functionality. njs is created in compliance with ECMAScript 5.1 (strict mode)
with some ECMAScript 6 and later extensions. The compliance is still evolving.

The documentation is available online:
